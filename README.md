## Get Inspired

Check out our [**collection of articles**](https://www.onbusinessplan.com/) for those beginning their Generative AI journey. Find tips, tricks, and motivational content to keep you engaged and motivated throughout your learning process.

## Setup

You need to create a virtual env and install the packages listed in `requirements.txt`. You can then run Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code.

Follow these steps: [How to Work with Python Virtual Environments, Jupyter Notebooks and VS Code](https://python.plainenglish.io/how-to-work-with-python-virtual-environments-jupyter-notebooks-and-vs-code-536fac3d93a1).

You need to create a `.env` file with your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Playground
