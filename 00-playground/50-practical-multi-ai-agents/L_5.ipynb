The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose by 0.2 percent month-over-month in December 2024. The annual inflation rate was 2.7 percent in November 2024, and the CPI was expected to rise 0.3 percent in December 2024.\n",

      "The stock market has been volatile in recent months, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 experiencing significant fluctuations.

      "Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Monitor Inflation Rate: Investors should closely monitor the inflation rate and its impact on the stock market.\n",

It is essential to continue monitoring the economy and staying up-to-date with the latest news and developments to ensure optimal investment strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relationship between equity prices and inflation is complex, and there is evidence to suggest that inflation can have both positive and negative effects on stock prices. In some cases, inflation can lead to higher stock prices, as companies may be able to increase their prices and maintain their profit margins. However, high inflation can also lead to decreased consumer spending, which can negatively impact stock prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of creating content based on inflation and stock market data, there are several approaches that can be taken.
