You can also specify the port number when initializing the FastMCP server. The remaining tool, prompt and resource definitions are all the same. So the following code for the MCP server is the same code you saw in Lesson 7. The transport is specified at the end, and the port number of `8001` is specified in the `FastMCP` constructor (you may also decide to choose the default port as well). "
