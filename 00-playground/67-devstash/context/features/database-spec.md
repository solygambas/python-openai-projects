# Prisma + Neon PostgreSQL Setup

## Overview

Set up Prisma ORM with Neon PostgreSQL database.

## Requirements

- Use Neon PostgreSQL (serverless)
- Create initial schema based on data models in project-overview.md (this will evolve)
- Include NextAuth models (Account, Session, VerificationToken)
- Add appropriate indexes and cascade deletes

## References

- Initial data models: `@context/project-overview.md`
- Database standards: `@context/coding-standards.md`
- Prisma docs: https://prisma.io/docs (Prisma 7 has breaking changes - fetch latest)

## Notes

We will have a development branch that we work on that will be in DATABASE_URL and then we will have a production branch. So we ALWAYS create migrations and never push directly unless specified.

IMPORTANT! Use Prisma 7, which has some breaking changes. Read the entire upgrade guide at https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/upgrade-guides/upgrading-versions/upgrading-to-prisma-7 to get a good idea of the changes.
