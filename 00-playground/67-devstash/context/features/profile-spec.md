# Profile Page

## Overview

Create the profile page with user info, stats, change password and delete account.

## Requirements

- Create profile page at `/profile` route
- Display user info: email, name, avatar (GitHub or initials), account creation date
- Show usage stats: total items, total collections, breakdown by item type
- Add account actions: change password (email users only), delete account with confirmation
- Follow existing codebase patterns for data fetching and components

## Notes

- Avatar logic: Use GitHub avatar from OAuth if available, otherwise generate initials from name/email
- Change password button should only appear for users who signed up with email/password (not GitHub OAuth)
- Delete account needs confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion
- Item type breakdown should show counts for each type (snippets, prompts, notes, commands, links, files, images)
- Route should be protected (require authentication)

```
