# AI Interaction Guidelines

## Communication

- Be concise and direct
- Explain non-obvious decisions briefly
- Ask before large refactors or architectural changes
- Don't add features not in the project spec
- Never delete files without clarification

## Workflow

This is the common workflow that we will use for every single feature/fix:

1. **Document** - Document the feature in @context/current-feature.md.
2. **Branch** - Create new branch for feature, fix, etc
3. **Implement** - Implement the feature/fix that I create in @context/current-feature.md
4. **Test** - Verify it works in the browser. Add/update unit tests for server actions and utilities (not components) and run `npm test`. Run `npm run build` and fix any errors
5. **Iterate** - Iterate and change things if needed
6. **Commit** - Only after build passes and everything works
7. **Merge** - Merge to main
8. **Delete Branch** - Delete branch after merge
9. **Review** - Review AI-generated code periodically and on demand.
10. Mark as completed in @context/current-feature.md and add to history

Do NOT commit without permission and until the build and tests pass. If build or tests fail, fix the issues first.

## Branching

We will create a new branch for every feature/fix. Name branch **feature/[feature]** or **fix[fix]**, etc. Ask to delete the branch once merged.

## Commits

- Ask before committing (don't auto-commit)
- Use conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, chore:, etc.)
- Keep commits focused (one feature/fix per commit)
- Never put "Generated With Claude" in the commit messages

## When Stuck

- If something isn't working after 2-3 attempts, stop and explain the issue
- Don't keep trying random fixes
- Ask for clarification if requirements are unclear

## Code Changes

- Make minimal changes to accomplish the task
- Don't refactor unrelated code unless asked
- Don't add "nice to have" features
- Preserve existing patterns in the codebase

## Git/Repository

- **Do NOT run `git init`** during feature implementation

### Workflow Commands

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'feat: [description]'
git checkout main && git merge feature/[branch-name]
git branch -d feature/[branch-name]
```

## Code Review

Review AI-generated code periodically, especially for:

- Security (auth checks, input validation)
- Performance (unnecessary re-renders, N+1 queries)
- Logic errors (edge cases)
- Patterns (matches existing codebase?)

## File Editing

Hooks automatically format files and inject updated content into context after every Edit/Write — you don't need to re-read between edits unless a tool call fails.

### Edit failures ("String not found")

1. Re-read the file — the hook may have failed silently
2. Copy the exact string from the Read output, with 2–3 lines of surrounding context
3. If Edit fails again — use Write to overwrite the full file (safe for files under 200 lines; risky for larger ones with concurrent changes)

### Long files (200+ lines)

- Never edit from memory — always confirm you have post-edit content in context
- Prefer MultiEdit over multiple sequential Edits to reduce stale-context risk

**Common causes of failures:** trailing whitespace, CRLF vs LF (mostly handled by hooks)
