Krempe, who harshly criticizes Victor\\'s previous studies of alchemists like Cornelius Agrippa, calling them outdated and worthless.\\n\\n3. He then meets Professor M. Waldman, who has a much more encouraging and gentle approach. Unlike Krempe, Waldman acknowledges the contributions of the ancient alchemists while promoting modern science.\\n\\n4. Waldman\\'s lecture inspires Victor deeply, particularly when he speaks about how modern scientists have acquired \"new and almost unlimited powers\" and can \"command the thunders of heaven.\"\\n\\n5. Victor begins to develop a strong interest in chemistry and natural philosophy under Waldman\\'s guidance. He becomes an eager and successful student, impressing both professors with his progress.\\n\\n6. Victor gains access to Waldman\\'s laboratory and equipment, and begins to excel in his studies. He makes rapid progress over the next two years, even making some discoveries that earn him recognition at the university.\\n\\nThis chapter is significant as it marks the beginning of Victor\\'s serious scientific studies and shows how Professor Waldman\\'s influence helps direct him toward the path that will eventually lead to his creation of the monster.
