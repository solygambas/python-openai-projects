      "is let's say plot the square footage of the house against the list price of the house, right, so \n",
      "you collect data on a bunch of houses. And let's say you get a data set like this with \n",
      "houses of different sizes that are listed for different amounts of money.  \n",
      "Now, let's say that I'm trying to sell a house in the same area as Portland, Oregon as \n",
      "where the data comes from. Let's say I have a house that's this size in square footage, and \n",
      "I want an algorithm to tell me about how much should I expect my house to sell for. So \n",
      "there are lots of ways to do this, and some of you may have seen elements of what I'm \n",
      "about to say before.  \n",
      "So one thing you could do is look at this data and maybe put a straight line to it. And then \n",
