    "# Lesson 3: Planning with o1\n",
    "One of the great use cases where `o1` models shine is creating a plan to solve a task given a set of tools to carry out the plan, and constraints to set bounds around the task. This kind of use case would be very slow if we used `o1` for every step, so what we'll do is generate a plan with `o1-mini` and then execute each step with `gpt-4o-mini`."

Log the backlogged status for the order.\\n                2. Proceed to **Notify Customer** about the backlogged status (Step 4a).\\n\\n3. **Arrange Shipping for Allocated Orders**\\n    a. **For each order with allocated stock:**\\n        i. Call `get_product_details(product_id)` to retrieve product weight and dimensions.\\n        ii. Call `calculate_shipping_options(destination, weight, dimensions)` with the order\\'s `destination`, `weight`, and `dimensions` to determine available shipping options and associated costs.\\n        iii. **Select the Optimal Shipping Option**\\n            - Evaluate the returned shipping options based on cost, delivery time, and carrier reliability to select the most suitable option.\\n        iv. Call `book_shipment(order_id, carrier_id, service_level)` with the chosen `carrier_id` and `service_level` to book the shipment for the order.\\n        v.

Call `send_order_update(customer_id, order_id, \"We are currently processing your order and experiencing a slight delay. Your order will be fulfilled as soon as the necessary components are available.\")` to inform the customer about the delay and reassure them that their order is being handled.\\n\\n5. **Complete the Instruction Set**\\n    - Call `instructions_complete()` to indicate that all steps in the order fulfillment plan have been executed.\\n\\n```\\n\\n'}\n",
